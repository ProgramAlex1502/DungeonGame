TITLE:   A Coat
AUTHOR:  William Butler Yeats
CONTENT: \
I made my song a coat       \\
Covered with embroideries   \\
Out of old mythologies      \\
From heel to throat;        \\
But the fools caught it,    \\
Wore it in the world's eyes \\
As though they'd wrought it.\\
Song, let them take it      \\
For there's more enterprise \\
In walking naked.

TITLE:   The road not taken
AUTHOR:  Robert Frost
CONTENT: \
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, \\
And sorry I could not travel both    \\
And be one traveler, long I stood    \\
And looked down one as far as I could\\
To where it bent in the undergrowth; \\
Then took the other, as just as fair,\\
And having perhaps the better claim, \\
Because it was grassy and wanted wear\\
Though as for that the passing there \\
Had worn them really about the same, \\
And both that morning equally lay    \\
In leaves no step had trodden black. \\
Oh, I kept the first for another day!\\
Yet knowing how way leads onto way,  \\
I doubted if I should ever come back.\\
I shall be telling this with a sigh  \\
Somewhere ages and ages hence;       \\
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I  \\
I took the one less traveled by,     \\
And that has made all the difference.

TITLE:   To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time
AUTHOR:  Robert Herrick
CONTENT: \
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,      \\
Old time is still a-flying;           \\
And this same flower that smiles today\\
Tomorrow will be dying.               \\
The glorious lamp of heaven the sun,  \\
The higher he's a-getting,            \\
The sooner will his race be run,      \\
And nearer he's to setting.           \\
That age is best which is the first,  \\
When youth and blood are warmer;      \\
But being spent, the worse, and worst \\
Times still succeed the former.       \\
Then be not coy, but use your time,   \\
And, while ye may, go marry;          \\
For, having lost but once your prime, \\
You may forever tarry.

TITLE:   A Dream Within A Dream
AUTHOR:  Edgar Allan Poe
CONTENT: \
Take this kiss upon the brow!  \\
And, in parting from you now,  \\
Thus much let me avow--        \\
You are not wrong, who deem    \\
That my days have been a dream;\\
Yet if hope has flown away     \\
In a night, or in a day,       \\
In a vision, or in none,       \\
Is it therefore the less gone? \\
All that we see or seem        \\
Is but a dream within a dream. \\
I stand amid the roar          \\
Of a surf-tormented shore,     \\
And I hold within my hand      \\
Grains of the golden sand--    \\
How few! yet how they creep    \\
Through my fingers to the deep,\\
While I weep--while I weep!    \\
O God! can I not grasp         \\
Them with a tighter clasp?     \\
O God! can I not save          \\
One from the pitiless wave?    \\
Is all that we see or seem     \\
But a dream within a dream?

AUTHOR:  Charles Bukowski
CONTENT: \
To give life you must take life,                      \\
and as our grief falls flat and hollow                \\
upon the billion-blooded sea                          \\
I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed     \\
with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures    \\
lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.\\
Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow        \\
did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be     \\
young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.         \\
I hated you when it would have taken less courage     \\
to love.

Do not go gentle into that good night,              \\
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;       \\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.          \\

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright       \\

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.          \\

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,     \\

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  \\
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,     \\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.          \\
                                                    \\
And you, my father, there on the sad height,        \\
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\\
Do not go gentle into that good night.              \\
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

In Flanders fields the poppies blow    \\
Between the crosses, row on row,       \\
That mark our place, and in the sky,   \\
The larks, still bravely singing, fly, \\
Scarce heard amid the guns below.      \\
                                       \\
We are the dead; short days ago        \\
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  \\
Loved and were loved, and now we lie   \\
In Flanders fields.                    \\
                                       \\
Take up our quarrel with the foe!      \\
To you from failing hands we throw     \\
The torch; be yours to hold it high!   \\
If ye break faith with us who die      \\
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow\\
In Flanders fields.

Heaven is what I cannot reach!       \\

TITLE:	 The Raven
AUTHOR:  Edgar Allan Poe
CONTENT: \
ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,              \\
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,-                   \\
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,              \\
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.                  \\
"'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door;              \\
    Only this and nothing more."                                            \\
                                                                            \\
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December                      \\
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.             \\
Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow                  \\
From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore,                \\
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:                \\
    Nameless here for evermore.                                             \\
                                                                            \\
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain                \\
Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;             \\
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating            \\
"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,                 \\
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:                   \\
    This it is and nothing more."                                           \\
                                                                            \\
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,                 \\
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;                 \\
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,              \\
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,                \\
That I scarce was sure I heard you"-here I opened wide the door:-           \\
    Darkness there and nothing more.                                        \\
                                                                            \\
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,     \\
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;            \\
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,              \\
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"            \\
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore:"             \\
    Merely this and nothing more.                                           \\
                                                                            \\
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,               \\
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.                   \\
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;           \\
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore;                \\
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore:                    \\
    'T is the wind and nothing more."                                       \\
                                                                            \\
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,         \\
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.               \\
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;         \\
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,              \\
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door:                   \\
    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.                                     \\
                                                                            \\
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling                    \\
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,-                 \\
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,  \\
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore:            \\
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"            \\
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \\
                                                                            \\
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,           \\
Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore;                     \\
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being                      \\
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,               \\
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,              \\
    With such name as "Nevermore."                                          \\
                                                                            \\
But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only                \\
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.              \\
Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,           \\
Till I scarcely more than muttered,-"Other friends have flown before;       \\
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."             \\
    Then the bird said, "Nevermore."                                        \\
                                                                            \\
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,                  \\
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,           \\
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster                    \\
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore:           \\
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                     \\
    Of 'Never-nevermore.'                                                   \\
                                                                            \\
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,                    \\
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;     \\
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking                   \\
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,                  \\
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore          \\
    Meant in croaking "Nevermore."                                          \\
                                                                            \\
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing                  \\
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;               \\
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining                \\
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,             \\
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er            \\
    She shall press, ah, nevermore!                                         \\
                                                                            \\
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer        \\
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.             \\
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee-by these angels he hath sent thee\\
Respite-respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!"                  \\
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore."           \\
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \\
                                                                            \\
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!         \\
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,           \\
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-                  \\
On this home by Horror haunted-tell me truly, I implore:                    \\
Is there-is there balm in Gilead?-tell me-tell me, I implore!"              \\
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \\
                                                                            \\
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil-prophet still, if bird or devil!          \\
By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,              \\
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,             \\
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore:                \\
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore!"               \\
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \\
                                                                            \\
"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting:  \\
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!            \\
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!           \\
Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!                  \\
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"       \\
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."                                           \\
                                                                            \\
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting           \\
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;                    \\
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,            \\
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor:       \\
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor            \\
    Shall be lifted-nevermore!

                                                \\
and, if necessary, the windows-                 \\
trees fifty, a hundred years old                \\
out there,                                      \\
heavy clouds on the way                         \\
and the lawn steaming like a horse              \\
in the early morning.

I want you to know                             \\
one thing.                                     \\
                                               \\
You know how this is:                          \\
if I look                                      \\
at the crystal moon, at the red branch         \\
of the slow autumn at my window,               \\
if I touch                                     \\
near the fire                                  \\
the impalpable ash                             \\
or the wrinkled body of the log,               \\
everything carries me to you,                  \\
as if everything that exists,                  \\
aromas, light, metals,                         \\
were little boats                              \\
that sail                                      \\
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.  \\
                                               \\
Well, now,                                     \\
if little by little you stop loving me         \\
I shall stop loving you little by little.      \\
                                               \\
If suddenly                                    \\
you forget me                                  \\
do not look for me,                            \\
for I shall already have forgotten you.        \\
                                               \\
If you think it long and mad,                  \\
the wind of banners                            \\
that passes through my life,                   \\
and you decide                                 \\
to leave me at the shore                       \\
of the heart where I have roots,               \\
remember                                       \\
that on that day,                              \\
at that hour,                                  \\
I shall lift my arms                           \\
and my roots will set off                      \\
to seek another land.                          \\
                                               \\
But                                            \\
if each day,                                   \\
each hour,                                     \\
you feel that you are destined for me          \\
with implacable sweetness,                     \\
if each day a flower                           \\
climbs up to your lips to seek me,             \\
ah my love, ah my own,                         \\
in me all that fire is repeated,               \\
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,    \\
my love feeds on your love, beloved,           \\
and as long as you live it will be in your arms\\
without leaving mine.

Hold fast to dreams         \\
For if dreams die           \\
Life is a broken-winged bird\\
That cannot fly.            \\
Hold fast to dreams         \\
For when dreams go          \\
Life is a barren field      \\
Frozen with snow.

The yards grow ghosts. Between the limbs and wings,\\
bleached street-lit things, I'm best at moving on. \\
Hunt-heavy, gray, slunk overlow like so            \\
much weight got in the way, my shape's the shape   \\
of something missed, flash-pop or empty frame.     \\
Though you could say I've made a game of this,     \\
and though midtrickery it might be true,           \\
when evening lingers in the key of leaving         \\
my senses swoon. A synonym for stay,               \\
I'm always coming back. I chew through traps.      \\
I love whatever doesn't get too close.

Brook,                              \\
Be still, - be still!               \\
Midnight's arch is broken           \\
In thy ceaseless ripples.           \\
Dark and cold below them            \\
Runs the troubled water, -          \\
Only on its bosom,                  \\
Shimmering and trembling,           \\
Doth the glinted star-shine         \\
                  Sparkle and cease.\\
                                    \\
                  Life,             \\
Be still, - be still!               \\
Boundless truth is shattered        \\
On thy hurrying current.            \\
Rest, with face uplifted,           \\
Calm, serenely quiet;               \\
Drink the deathless beauty -        \\
Thrills of love and wonder          \\
Sinking, shining, star-like;        \\
Till the mirrored heaven            \\
Hollow down within thee             \\
Holy deeps unfathomed,              \\
Where far thoughts go floating,     \\
And low voices wander               \\
                  Whispering peace.

TITLE:   Wall of Darkness
AUTHOR:  Diana van den Berg

I stood and looked in the cool of the twilight -\\
the sun was peacefully sinking low,             \\
her last rays glowing and lovingly encompassing \\
the world in a soft and rich, warm glow.        \\
                                                \\
Suddenly a trembling, rumbling, grumbling       \\
shook the world of that mighty plain.           \\
and out of the east, with a powerful thundering,\\
the wild black horses of dark night came,       \\
                                                \\
Tossing their heads as they galloped in number, \\
their tails outstretched in the whistling wind. \\
I stood transfixed as they surged towards me,   \\
unable to move or turn away.                    \\
                                                \\
Larger and larger they grew and larger,         \\
until in their race they surrounded me.         \\
With thrashing hooves in their furious charge,  \\
they rushed right on to the western sea.        \\
                                                \\
Until they reached those deep, deep waters,     \\
and left me behind in the night - alone.
