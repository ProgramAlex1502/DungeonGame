  "tutorial": "The Game\nDungeon is a text-based, turn-based, open-world role-playing game.\n\nThe World\nYou are in control of a character and completely free to explore the world in which you start. This world is a tridimensional matrix of locations that vary from arid deserts to warm and moist swamps. Different foes lurk the land but will not attack you unless you harm them, what allows you to explore the world freely while searching for items.\nOn the ground, you will find a wide variety of items, from small edible fruits to fearsome weapons and tomes about magical spells. Collecting these items and using them in the appropriate occasions is the difference between conquering this world and dying to a rat.\n\nThe Character\nThe character is a human who woke up one day without remembering anything about what happened. He finds himself in a strange place and surrounded by various different creatures. While some of these creatures are familiar to him, there are monsters he has never seen before. \n\nCommands\nAt any time, you can issue 'commands' to see a complete list of commands.\nIn order to walk to a given direction, issue 'go' followed by the direction towards which you want to move the character. e.g., 'go north'. Alternatively, use only the first character of the direction, as in 'go s'.\nTo issue your character to attempt to kill a creature use 'kill' followed by part of the name of the creature.\nThe wiki is a quite useful resource. Simply use the 'wiki' command followed by whatever you want to search.\n\nThe Project\nDungeon is made with Java (SE 6) and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.\nThe 'license' command displays some text from the license. There is also a wiki entry (\"License\") on the license."
