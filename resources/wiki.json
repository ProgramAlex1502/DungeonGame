      "content": "Dungeon has dozens of achievements for you to unlock. All achievements will be unlocked by simple exploration and battling, but some have requirements much harder to satisfy than others. Although there are not any rewards for unlocking achievements - because the lead developer considers that too unrealistic, even for a fantasy world -, they are a nice way to measure your progress in the game.\n\nYou can look up the achievements you have already unlocked with the 'achievements' command. It is also possible to sort the output of this command with 'by name' and 'by date'."

      "content": "Bats are mammals whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. They are natural inhabitants of humid and quiet places, such as graveyards. The danger bats present in Dungeon varies according to the locations' luminosity. The darker the place is, more likely the bats are to hit and to critically hit. Engaging bats during daytime out in the open vastly increases the chance of success."

Only eating and sleeping will heal you up to your full health and sleeping can only be done at night."

      "content": "Fruit bats are not always large: the smallest species is just six centimeters long. The largest attain a wingspan of 1.7 meters, weighing up to 1.6 kilograms. Most have large eyes, allowing them to orient themselves visually in twilight and inside caves and forests. Their sense of smell is excellent. In contrast to other bats, fruit bats do not use echolocation (with one exception, the Egyptian fruit bat, which uses high-pitched tongue clicks to navigate in caves)."

      "title": "Green Iguana",
      "content": "The green iguana or common iguana is a large, arboreal, mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus Iguana. Despite their name, green iguanas can come in different colors. They are diurnal, arboreal, and are often found near water. When frightened by a predator, green iguanas will attempt to flee, and if near a body of water, they dive into it and swim away. Agile climbers, iguanas can fall up to fifteen meters and land unhurt (iguanas use their hind leg claws to clasp leaves and branches to break a fall). During cold, wet weather, green iguanas prefer to stay on the ground for greater warmth. When swimming, an iguana remains submerged, letting its four legs hang limply against its side. They propel through the water with powerful tail strokes."

      "title": "Time",
      "content": "Time passes after every turn. How much each turn lasts, however, depends on what the character did. Watches are used to keep precise track of time. Looking the time (using a watch) costs a little time, though. The character needs about four seconds to see what time it is in an equipped watch and around ten seconds to look up the time in a clock placed on his or hers backpack. A broken watch usually displays the time it broke. If the character is equipping a broken watch but has a working one in his or hers backpack, any attempt to look up the time will result in the character picking up the watch in his or hers backpack."
